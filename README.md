Roots are: -5, 10 and -10

#
#### Runge Kutta method to solve a first order ordinary differential equation:

The Classic_Runge_Kutta_FirstOrder_ODE.py file uses the classic RK4 method to find approximations, at equally spaced time points, to the exact solution of the following first order ordinary differential equation:
